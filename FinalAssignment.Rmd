# **What Is It?**

I chose to create a personal website for my final project. This website contains/will contain all the information relevant to me such as my socials links, resume, and any research if that is what I do in the future. Right now it is pretty empty but I hope to fill it up more in the coming years. I chose to make a website because I was interested in the process of making one and I though that this would be a useful skill if I was to persue a career in a stem field.

You can acess my website [here](https://joshmondz.github.io)

# **How to Make a Website**

1. To begin you are going to want to create a new GitHub repository. This can be done my clicking the green "new" box on the [GitHub Homepage](https://github.com). Name this repository <GitHub Username>.github.io where <GitHub Username> is your github username. Make sure to add a license and a brief description.

2. Copy and paste the following code to your terminal to clone your repository to your computer.

```
git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
```
 + (username is your GitHub username)
 
3. Now you want to select your website theme. You can find tons of free options all over the internet but a helpful website for finding themes is [Jekyll](https://jekyllthemes.io). On Jekyll you can browse themes that cost money as well as free themes. Once you find a theme that you like, make sure it has a link to a github repository. If it does, make sure that repository is well documented (you will save yourself a lot of pain by doing this).

4. Once you have a theme, go over to that theme's repository and click the green "<> code" box and download the zip file.

5. Unzip the file and copy and paste its contents into your repository file (it should be titled username.github.io)

6. Using the terminal, add, commit, and push the changes. Here is where I had trouble. If you are having trouble as well, one easy solution is to make a new RStudio project with the title being username.github.io and the link being a copy and pasted link from the green "<> code" box from your repository. From here you can re-copy and paste the contents of the zip file into the project folder and add, commit, and push through RStudio's terminal.

7. Go to your GitHub repository page and click on settings/pages. Select the box titled "None" and switch it to "Main". Now your website should be up and you can access it by typing username.github.io into your url.

8. Making changes to your website will be different depending on the theme you selected so I recommend you take your time to research the files in your repository. Some good places to start are the README file and _config.yml. From here just follow along with the authors instructions on how to change the website. This will require a lot of trial and error but eventually your website will be shaped to how you want it to look.
