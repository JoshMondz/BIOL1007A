  # I was thin king of creating a dataframe first, then editing the values in it

#   dframe <- data.frame(Type, Value)
#   return(dframe)
# }
# ^ A more efficient function

# Question 2
Df <- myDframe()
head(Df)

# Question 3
analysis <- aov(Value ~ Type, data = Df)
summary(analysis)

# Question 4
pVal <- function(DFrame = NULL){
  anova <- aov(as.formula(paste(names(DFrame)[2], "~", names(DFrame)[1])), data = DFrame)
  # I looked up the aov function above but I am able to understand it. the paste
  # function concatenates the strings together to make it in a format similar to 
  # this: "y ~ x" as a string. The as.formula then turns that string into a read
  # -able formula
  return(summary(anova)[[1]][["Pr(>F)"]][1])
